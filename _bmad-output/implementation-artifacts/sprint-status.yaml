# Sprint Status - Phase 0 Walking Skeleton
# Generated: 2026-02-11
# Project: ndb_hugo-tailbliss
# Strategy: Hybrid approach - complete architecture, create one focused epic, implement

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in this plan
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created, ready for development
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review
#   - done: Story completed
#
# PHASE 0 STRATEGY:
# =================
# Frontend-first priority: Update portfolio UI to implement design spec,
# deploy to Netlify, document progress as posts. BackOffice developed in
# parallel later (separate repo).
#
# Hybrid Approach:
# 1. Complete architecture doc (foundational reference)
# 2. Create Phase 0 portfolio epic via epics workflow (5-8 stories)
# 3. Implement stories → deploy → document progress
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Architecture doc formalizes decisions from 2026-02-11 sync session
# - Epic will break design spec implementation into logical components
# - Each story ships value independently (nav, hero, posts, timeline, footer)
# - Deploy to Netlify after each major component
# - Document progress through posts (feeds the pearl system later)
